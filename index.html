    <p>My pet journey: Before I was born, my parents had a black french bull dog named Bella. About maybe 3 years after
        I was born, we got another dog. He was a bull mastif puppy named Buddah. Even as a puppy, he was way bigger than
        me, and I was terrified of him, so my mom gave him back to the breeder after about 1 or 2 years. We had Bella
        for a long time. She came with us for our house journey, where we rented like 5 houses before settling in
        Jupiter, Fl. But sadly, when I was about 5 years old, she had to be put down at a young age due to back
        problems. But my family hates to be without a pet for too long, so we got a kitten. Even though my mom and my
        older brother were both allergic. It was because at the time my favorite animal was a cat and we wanted to try
        something different. His name was Gato. We were at the pet store one day, and my mom let be bring home a pink
        beta fish. I named her princess. We had princess for about a week until one day. You know what is not a good
        idea? Having a fish in a small, open tank that is very reachable if you can hop onto a counter. And you know
        what kind of animal can jump up on counters and loves to eat fish? Cats. Did we own one? Yes. I woke up one
        morning to find Princess just completley missing out of her tank. Our woking theory is that Gato ate her. About
        a week later, we had to give Gato back to the shelter because my mom and my older brother couldn't handle their
        alergies, and he would always scratch me and my little brother, and he was very destructive. We later got a new
        puppy. Her name is Rosie and she is a mut mix. A year later, we got a new puppy. His name was Bones and was a
        chihuahua. A few months later, We went on a trip to North Carolina, and my older brother house sat. When we got
        home, we found out he had gotten 4 turtles, 3 cleaner fish, and 1 tiny baby goldfish was accidentally thrown in
        with the turtles. The turtles were named after the ninja turtles, and I named The cleaner fish Angela, Ginger,
        and Ben, and I named the goldfish Tom. When I was 7, we were gonna move to Colorado, and we had to give Bones to
        my older brother's dad. He really liked him when he met him at my older brother's graduation party. We were
        afraid of Bones freezing in the Colorado cold with his thin coat, and his being eaten or taken away by
        predetors. So he is still there in Florida. Rosie came with us on our road trip all the way to Colorado, and
        only like a week while we were in our rental house, we got a new puppy and we named her Raven. She is a
        bernadoodle, a bernese mountain dog doodle. About 3 years later, we had obviously moved into our new house, and
        we got a new puppy. His name is KIng and is is a shorkie. A shi tzu mixed with a yorkie. We still have all those
        three, and are currently in a new rental house, waiting to move into our new custom home.
